      <div class="about-block">
        <p class="purpose-description">Hi, I'm Taylor and I'm and senior at Clear Brook! This website was developed as part of my Independent Study Mentorship where I researched the digital gap between socioeconomic classes and how that gap applies to the school setting within extracurriculars. Equal education and computer science are two subjects I am truly passionate about, thus I hoped to merge the two to help make an impact. </p>
